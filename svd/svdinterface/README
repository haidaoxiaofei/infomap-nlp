			     SVDINTERFACE
                           ================

The las2.c file is part of the SVDPACKC linear algebra library from
the University of Tennessee.  (Please see las2.c for a copyright
notice.)  The other contents of this directory are a wrapper around las2.c.

Input:
------

The input matrix is expected in _column-major_ format, written to two
files: coll.XXXX and ind.XXXX (where 'XXXX' is the file extension, by
convention the number of pre-SVD dimensions, which becomes one
argument to 'svdinterface' below.)

	coll.XXXX

	contains entries of the form

	r0 n0
	r1 n1
	...
	ri nj

	where rx is a row number and nx is the co-occurrence count in
	the cell [x,y] for the current column y.  Only pairs <rx, nx>
	with nx > 0 are written in coll.XXXX, the others are skipped.
	These columns of entries are written out for all columns y.

	indx.XXXX

	contains a list of numbers

	m0
	m1
	...
	mj

	for all columns y, 0 <= y <= j.  For all y, my is the number
	of non-zero entries in columns y.  Thus indx.XXXX has as many
	lines as there are columns in the pre-SVD matrix, and all the
	numbers in indx.XXXX add up to the number of lines in
	coll.XXXX.


Note: The program will assume that everything is in the current
directory and write its output to the current directory as well!


Usage: 
------

Invoke svdinterface in the directory in which the collocation file
resides (cf. the remark at the end of the previous section.)

Output:
-------

The program writes four files:

    left	   left vectors
    rght	   right vectors
    sing	   singular values
    diag	   some information

The file containing the "shortened" vectors we go on to use in
calculating similarity is "left.XXXX".
