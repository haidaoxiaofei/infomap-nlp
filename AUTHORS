The Infomap NLP software was originally written by Stefan Kaufmann,
based on earlier work by Hinrich Schuetze, who developed the Infomap
algorithm.

Dominic Widdows <dwiddows@csli.stanford.edu> added functionality
including the orthogonal vector "NOT" feature.  He also contributed to
the documentation.

Beate Dorow <dorowbe@ims.uni-stuttgart.de> made various improvements
and feature additions.

Scott Cederberg <cederber@csli.stanford.edu> did various refactoring
and clean-up to prepare for public distribution.  He wrote most of the
documentation.  He also autoconfiscated the package, and so can
probably be blamed for most installation malfunctions.

The University of Tennessee, and particularly Mike Berry, wrote the
SVDPACKC library, of which svd/svdinterface/las2.c is a part.  Please
note that this file is distributed under a different license from the
rest of the package; see the file COPYING for details.
