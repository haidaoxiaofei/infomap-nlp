<h2>Infomap Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
<p>Ah, the dreaded &quot;troubleshooting&quot; section.  Please allow
us to encourage you to keep your wits about you and your hopes up, as
you have a good chance of resolving the problem.</p>

<h3><a name="software"/>Troubleshooting a Failed Software
Build</h3>
<p>The first thing to check is that you have downloaded the version of
the Infomap software appropriate to your operating system, if there is
one.  Please check that before proceeding.</p>

<p>If a version of the software is not available for your operating
system (and your system is a version of Unix or Linux), you should
still be able to make it work.  In this case, we recommend starting
with the Solaris version of the source and following the instructions
below.</p>

<p>The Infomap software should work on most versions of Unix (or
&quot;Unix-like&quot; systems such as Linux) with slight
modifications, although it has not been widely tested or ported.  The
adaptation most likely to be necessary is the replacement of
references to one header file (in <tt>#include</tt> lines in the
source code) with references to another header file.  This can fix
problems where the code calls a library function that is available on
your system, but is defined in a different header file from that
included by the code.  (NOTE: XXX XXX Also necessary to change
&quot;-l&quot; lines in relevant Makefiles to locate the libraries
containing these functions.  We should describe how to do that.)</p>

<p>It is also
possible that the code makes calls to library functions not available
in the libraries on your system.  In this case, it is likely that your
system provides an equivalent or near-equivalent function under a
different name; if so you can replace calls to the missing functions
with calls to the equivalent functions available on your system.  You
should be able to find manpages for the missing functions on Google if
you need to understand their functionality.  (We also recommend the
excellent tutorial/reference work <i>Advanced Programming in the Unix
Environment</i> by W. Richard Stevens as a place to look up unknown
library functions.)</p>

<p>Finally, if our software uses a function for which there is no
equivalent on your system, it can only be made to work by installing
the necessary function or by writing code to replace its
functionality.  In this case we may be able to help you find the
appropriate library from a freely downloadable source.</p>

<p>Whether or not you are able to solve your problems on your own (and
regardless of how hard you have tried), we would greatly appreciate
hearing from you.  We would like both to help you solve your problems,
if we can, and to make the software more robuste and portable for
future users.  We particularly exhort you to contact us if you
encouter problems that seem not to fall into the categories described
in this troubleshooting guide, since they may reflect issues we are
not yet aware of.</p>
