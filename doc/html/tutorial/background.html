<title>Infomap NLP Software -- Background for Tutorials</title>

<h2>Background Information for Understanding Tutorials</h2>
<p>A <i>corpus</i> is a collection of text that is used for research
in natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics.  A
corpus consists of one or more <i>documents</i>; how documents are
defined (and how long each document tends to be) depends on the
particular corpus.  In a corpus of news articles, for instance, it is
likely that each article will be considered a document.</p>

<p><i>Files</i> in a corpus are the actual computer files used to
store the corpus on disk.  The correspondence between files and
documents can vary.  In particular, one file may contain a single
document, or it may contain multiple documents.  It is also possible
that a file may contain a fragment of a document (with the rest of
that document stored in other files), or fragments of multiple
different documents, or some complete documents and fragments of other
documents.</p>

<p>The Infomap NLP software does not currently except corpora
in these more complicated formats.  It accepts two types of corpora:
<ol>
<li>Corpora consisting of a single file, which contains one or more
documents.  The documents are delimited within that file by XML-like
<tt>&lt;DOC&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;/DOC&gt;</tt> tags.</li>
<li>Corpora consisting of multiple files, in which each file consists
of exactly one document.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>It is still possible to work with corpora in other formats, by
filtering these corpora with other software that accepts their formats
as input and generates output in one of the two formats understood by
the Infomap software.  Since the Infomap formats are very simple, it
should in most cases be quite easy to write such filters.</p>

<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the Infomap corpus
formats by example, and to walk you through the stages of converting a
corpus into the Infomap format and using the Infomap NLP software to
build models from the converted corpus.</p>
