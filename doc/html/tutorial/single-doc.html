<title>Infomap NLP Software -- Single Document Tutorial Example</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2 align="center">Single Document Tutorial Example</h2>

<p>Since the Infomap software is incapable of constructing documents
from document fragments stored in multiple files (see the <a
href="background.html">tutorial background information</a>), a
single-document corpus must always consist of a single file.  For the
Infomap software to produce meaningful results it needs a good deal of
data, so the single document in our corpus will be a rather large
document:  the King James Bible.  The King James Bible is freely
available in electronic form from the <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">Gutenberg Project</a>; it is
available as a single file from <a href="">here</a>.  (You can also
download a copy from the Infomap server <a href="kjbible.txt">from here</a>.)
</p>

<p>Please download this file to your computer now.  On my computer,
this file is stored as
<tt>/home/cederber/corpora/kjbible/kjbible.txt</tt>, and that is how I
will refer to it in the examples that follow.  Don't forget to
substitute the name of the file on your system when you follow along
with the examples.</p>

<p>The first step in building a model from this corpus is to add
appropriate annotations to the <tt>kjbible.txt</tt> file so that the
Infomap software can process it.  In this example, where the entire
corpus is to be treated as a single document, we need to add a total
of four XML-like tags, as follows:
<ol><li>A single <tt>&lt;DOC&gt;</tt> tag, at the very beginning of
the file.  This tag marks the beginning of a document.</li>

<li>A single <tt>&lt;TEXT&gt;</tt> tag, before the beginning of
the text of the Bible itself, but after the header information
appearing at the beginning of the file, which describes the Gutenberg
Project and so forth.  This tag should be inserted between the line
reading<pre>
The First Book of Moses:  Called Genesis
</pre>and the line reading<pre>
1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
</pre>
The <tt>&lt;TEXT&gt;</tt> tag marks the beginning of the part of each
document that is actually considered by the Infomap NLP software as it
builds a model.  The text between the <tt>&lt;DOC&gt;</tt> tag
and the <tt>&lt;TEXT&gt;</tt> tag can provide meta-information about
the document, such as the document's title, but such information is
not interpreted by the Infomap software.  
This meta-information text may contain other XML-like tags (such as
<tt>&lt;TITLE&gt;</tt>).
</li>

<li>A single <tt>&lt;/TEXT&gt;</tt> tag, coming after the text of the
document and before the <tt>&lt;/DOC&gt;</tt> tag (below).  Any
information between the <tt>&lt;/TEXT&gt</tt> and
<tt>&lt;/DOC&gt;</tt> tags is ignored when building a model.  In this
example, add the <tt>&lt;/TEXT&gt;</tt> tag to the very end of the file.
</li>

<li>A single <tt>&lt;/DOC&gt;</tt> tag.  Add this tag to the very end
of the file, after the <tt>&lt;/TEXT&gt;</tt> tag that you added in
step 3.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>With these tags in place, the corpus is in the proper format and is
ready to be processed by the Infomap software.  Two steps remain:
compiling the software and using it to process the corpus.</p>

<p>To compile the software, simply type <tt>make</tt> in the
top-level directory of the Infomap software distribution.  With a
little luck, the compilation will run without errors.  If it fails,
most likely you can get it to work with a few minor changes.  Please
see <a href="../troubleshooting.html">this guide</a> for instructions.
You can also <a href="../contact.html">contact us</a> for help.</p>

<p>Once the software is compiled, you should make some changes to the
<tt>Makefile</tt> to indicate the location of the corpus.  Changes the
values of <tt>Makefile</tt> variables as follows:<pre>
CORPUS_NAME = kjbible
CORPUS_LONG_NAME = King James Bible
CORPUS_DESCRIP = The King James Bible, from the Gutenberg Project

CORPUS_FILE = /home/cederber/corpora/kjbible/kjbible.txt
CORPUS_DIR = /home/cederber/corpora/kjbible/
</pre>
These changes tell the software where the corpus is, and give the
corpus various descriptive names to be used for different
purposes.  (Remember that the <tt>CORPUS_FILE</tt> and <tt>CORPUS_DIR</tt>
variables should have values indicating where you saved the King James
Bible file on your system; the values above are exampls taken from my
system.)  
</p>

<p>When the software runs, it will produce a <i>model</i>, which will
consist of a number of files stored in a single directory.  This model
will be created in a working directory; it can later be installed to a
more permanent location.  You should create two empty directories for
these purposes, and change the <tt>Makefile</tt> variables
<tt>WORKING_DATA_DIR</tt> and <tt>INSTALLED_DATA_DIR</tt> to the names
of these directories.</p>

<p>All of the other Makefile variables can be left as they are.  You
are now ready to run the software; type <tt>make data</tt> to do
so.</p>

<p>This process will take a little while; if it fails, first look for
obvious causes, such as a misspelled directory name.  If you get
stuck, please <a href="../contact.html">contact us</a> and describe
the problem.</p>

<p>Once <tt>make data</tt> has completed, type <tt>make
installdata</tt>.  When this is done, the model is installed and ready
for use.</p>

<h3>Using the Model</h3>

<p>Now you can see the results!  Run the <tt>associate</tt> program in
the <tt>search/</tt> subdirectory of the top-level <tt>infomap/</tt>
directory.  You should see something like the following:<pre>

No query terms specified.


Usage:  `associate [-w | -d | -q] 
                ( [-t toc_file] [-c model(corpus)_tag] | [-m model_dir] )
                [-n num_neighbors] [-f vector_output_file]
                <pos_term_1> [pos_term_2 ... pos_term_n]
                [NOT neg_term_1 ... neg_term_n]'

        Task:   -w      associate words (DEFAULT)
                -d      associate documents
                -q      print query vector

        Models (default.toc):
                kjbible (kjbible) (DEFAULT)

</pre>
Note that the bottom of this output indicates that the
<tt>kjbible</tt> model has been installed.</p>

<p>Try the command <tt>associate moses</tt>.  This will return the
words in the King James Bible that are conceptually &quot;most
similar&quot; to <tt>moses</tt> in this model.  You should see
something like this:<pre>
moses:1.000000
aaron:0.605078
congregation:0.432336
sinai:0.424203
commanded:0.406323
edifieth:0.388591
hazeroth:0.386311
miriam:0.382260
evident:0.368226
...
</pre>
Play around with some other queries to get a sense for what has been
learned.  Keep in mind that by NLP standards, the Bible is quite a
small corpus, so results may be of inconsistent quality.</p>
