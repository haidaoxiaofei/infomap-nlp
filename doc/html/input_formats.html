<h2>Corpus Input Formats for the Infomap Software</h2>
<ul><li><a href="#single_file">Single-file corpora</a></li>
    <li><a href="#multi_file">Multiple-file corpora</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Infomap software is capable of processing corpora in two
distinct input formats.  A <i>single-file corpus</i> consists of a
single file that contains the entire corpus; the documents making up
the corpus are delimited using XML-like begin-document and
end-document tags.  A <i>multiple-file corpus</i> has one file per
document.  These two corpus formats are described in more detail
below.</p>


<h3><a name="single_file"/>Single-file corpora</h3>
<p>
In a single-file corpus, the entire corpus (consisting of one or more
documents) is containted by a single file on disk.  The beginning of
each document is marked by a <tt>&lt;DOC&gt;</tt> tag; the end of
each document by a <tt>&lt;/DOC&gt;</tt> tag.  Within each document,
the beginning of the document's text (as opposed to header
information like a title or document number) appears between a
<tt>&lt;TEXT&gt;</tt> tag and a <tt>&lt;/TEXT&gt;</tt> tag.  Everying
outside these text tags is ignored by the Infomap software.
</p>

<h3><a name="multi_file"/>Multiple-file corpora</h3>
<p>
In a multiple-file corpus, each disk file that is part of the corpus
must contain exactly one document.  No tags are used; the entire
contents of the file are considered to make up the text of the
document and are processed by the Infomap software.
