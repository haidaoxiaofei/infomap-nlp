<h2><a name="intro"/>Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Infomap software is based on the concept of a
<i>model</i>; each model consists of the files in a directory
known as the &quot;model directory&quot; or &quot;model data
directory&quot; for that model.  The Infomap software performs two
basic functions:  <i>building</i> models by learning them from a
free-text corpus using certain learning parameters specified by the
user, and <i>searching</i> an existing model to find the words or
documents that best match a query according to that model.  After a
model has been built, it can also be <i>installed</i> to make searching it
more convenient, and to allow other users to search it conveniently.</p>

<p>This manual describes how to use the Infomap software to <a
href="#building">build</a> models and to <a
href="#searching">search</a> models once they have been built.  It
also discusses <a href="#installing">installing</a> models.</p>

<p>Model-building and search are performed using an algorithm similar
to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (a/k/a Latent Semantic Indexing, or
LSI).  For details on how the Infomap algorithm works, please see the
<a href="algorithm.html">Infomap Algorithm Description</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="exintro"/>Introduction to Examples</a></h2> 
<p>To make the discussion of building and searching models more
concrete, this manual uses two running examples.  Each example
involves a fictitious corpus that we imagine to be in one of the two
<a href="input_formats.html">input formats</a> recognized by the
model-building software.  If you would like to follow a worked example
using corpora that are included with the software distribution,
see the <a href="tutorial/index.html">Infomap tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The <tt>sf</tt> corpus is entirely in a single file,
<tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/sf/sf.txt</tt>.  The <tt>many</tt> corpus
consists of many files, all of which are in the directory
<tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/many/</tt>.  The file
<tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/manyNames.txt</tt> contains the filenames
of all of the files making up the <tt>many</tt> corpus.  Details on
the formats of these two imaginary corpora (which are the two formats
that the Infomap model-building code can currently parse) can be found
in <a href="input_formats.html">this document</a>.</p>

<p>For the sake of later examples, we will imagine that the
<tt>sf</tt> corpus consists of articles published recently in a
mainstream U.S. newspaper, and that the <tt>many</tt> corpus consists
of medical journal papers.</p>

<h2><a name="building"/>Building a Model</a></h2>
<p>Building a model with the Infomap software consists of three steps:
<ul><li><a href="#building_s">Building (compiling) and installing</a> 
    the Infomap software.</li>
    <li><a href="#building_c">Obtaining a corpus</a> in the
appropriate format.</li>
    <li>Running the software to 
    <a href="#building_m">build the model.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="building_s"/>Building (Compiling) and Installing the Infomap
Software</h3>
<p>The Infomap software uses the GNU build system, in particular <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>.  Therefore,
from the top-level directory created when you unpack the distribution
tarball, you should run <pre>
  $ ./configure
  $ make
</pre>
The first of these steps determines various things about your system.
In particular, it checks for a DBM-compatible database library.
If any of these checks fails, you will need to correct the problem
before compilation can proceed.  Please examine the output of
<tt>configure</tt> carefully to determine what the problem is.  It may
be that you need to install a DBM-compatible library, like <a href="
http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/gdbm.html">GNU DBM</a> (also
available as RPM and .deb packages for Linux).</p>

<p>If you have difficulty correcting the problem, please send mail to
<a
href="mailto:infomap-nlp-users@lists.sourceforge.net">infomap-nlp-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>The second step (running <tt>make</tt>) compiles the software.  If
<tt>configure</tt> succeeded, then <tt>make</tt> should run without
problems.  If <tt>make</tt> has trouble after a successful
<tt>configure</tt>, please report the problem to <a
href="mailto:infomap-nlp-users@lists.sourceforge.net">infomap-nlp-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<p>Once the software has been compiled by a successful <tt>make</tt>,
you should install it.  This is done using the command <tt>make
install</tt>.  By default, the installed files are placed in various
subdirectories of the <tt>/usr/local</tt> directory.  For instance,
executable programs are installed in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>, and
manual pages are installed in <tt>/usr/local/man</tt>.  Shared data
files used by the Infomap NLP software are installed in
<tt>/usr/local/share/infomap-nlp/</tt>.  This HTML documentation is
installed in <tt>/usr/local/share/doc/infomap-nlp/</tt>.</p>

<p>Installing to <tt>/usr/local</tt> requires root access.  To perform
this default installation, you would use:<pre>
  $ su
  Password: (enter root password)
  # make install
  # exit
  $
</pre>

<p>The advantage of installing to <tt>/usr/local</tt> (or to another
standard systemwide directory, like <tt>/usr</tt>) is that the
programs and manual pages should automatically become available to all
users on your system.  The disadvantage is that root access is
required.  If
you need to install to another location, you can use the
<tt>--prefix</tt> option to the <tt>configure</tt> command.  </p>

<p>For example, imagine that your username is <tt>jrandom</tt> and
your home directory is <tt>/home/jrandom</tt> (you should replace
<tt>/home/jrandom</tt> with your actual home directory, or another
directory of your choice, in the examples below).  Then, suppose you
want to install to subdirectories of
<tt>/home/jrandom/install</tt> (i.e. programs go to
<tt>/home/jrandom/install/bin</tt>, man pages go to
<tt>/home/jrandom/install/man</tt>, and so forth), you would use the 
following sequence of commands:<pre>
  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/jrandom/install
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>
In this case, you would want to add <tt>/home/jrandom/install/bin</tt>
to your <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable, and
<tt>/home/jrandom/install/man</tt> to your <tt>MANPATH</tt>.



<h3><a name="building_c"/>Corpus Formats</h3> <p>This user manual and
its examples assume that you have a corpus in a format that can be
parsed by the Infomap software.  It may be necessary for you to
convert a corpus's format before using the software on that corpus.
The Infomap software accepts corpora in two simple formats, which are
described <a href="input_formats.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="building_m"/>Building a Model With the Infomap Software</h3>
<p>Infomap models are built using the <tt>infomap-build</tt> program,
which automatically invokes other Infomap NLP programs.  The
<tt>infomap-build(1)</tt> manual page (run <tt>man infomap-build</tt>
to see it) gives details of how to run this program, but imitating the
examples below is probably an easier way to use it for the first time.

<h4><a name="single_file_build"/>Building a model from a single-file
corpus</a></h4>

<p>Consider building a model from our single-file <tt>sf</tt> <a
href="#exintro">example corpus</a>.  Recall that this corpus consists
of the single file <tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/sf/sf.txt</tt>.  Let's
say that we want this model to be called <tt>sf</tt> after the name of
the corpus, and that we would like the directory containing the
<tt>sf</tt> model files (known as the <i>model data directory</i>) to
be created in <tt>/home/jrandom/infomap_models</tt>.</p>

<p>First, we set the environment variable <tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt>
to <tt>/home/jrandom/infomap_models</tt>.  This environment variable
is used by the <tt>infomap-build</tt> program to determine where it
should create model data directories when it builds models.  It is
called the working directory because it is the place where models are
stored as they are being built.  (After building, we can use the
<tt>infomap-install</tt> program to install the files from the working
directory to a different location.)  To set the environment variable
in <tt>sh</tt> or <tt>bash</tt>, run <pre>
  $ INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR=/home/jrandom/infomap_models
  $ export INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR
</pre>
In <tt>csh</tt> or <tt>tcsh</tt>, use <pre>
  % setenv INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR /home/jrandom/infomap_models
</pre>
</p>

<p>Once <tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt> is set, simply run<pre>
  $ infomap-build -s /usr/local/share/corpora/sf/sf.txt sf
</pre>
This command tells <tt>infomap-build</tt> to build a model called
<tt>sf</tt> from the corpus contained in the single file
<tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/sf/sf.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>When this command is done, the directory
<tt>/home/jrandom/infomap_models/sf</tt> should exist and should
contain a number of files.  At this point you can <a
href="#searching">search the model</a> using the <tt>associate</tt>
program, or <a href="#installing_m">install the model</a>.</p>

<p>To build a model from the <tt>many</tt> <a href="#exintro">example
corpus</a>, we set <tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt> in the same way.
Then, assuming we would like to call this model <tt>many_01</tt>
we run<pre>
  $ infomap-build -m /usr/local/share/corpora/manyNames.txt many_01
</pre>
This command tells <tt>infomap-build</tt> to build a model called
<tt>many_01</tt> from the corpus made up of the files listed in
<tt>/usr/local/share/corpora/manyNames.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>When this command is done, the directory
<tt>/home/jrandom/infomap_models/many_01</tt> should exist and should
contain a number of files.  At this point you can <a
href="#searching">search the model</a> using the <tt>associate</tt>
program, or <a href="#installing_m">install the model</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="installing_m"/>Installing an Infomap Model</h4>
<p>Before installing a model it is generally a good idea to test the
model by searching it using the <tt>associate</tt> program.  See <a
href="#searching">instructions on searching</a>.</p>

<p>Models are installed using the <tt>infomap-install</tt> program.
This program copies some of the model files created by
<tt>infomap-build</tt> from the working directory to a more permanent
<i>model directory</i>.  There are at least three advantages to doing
this:
<ol><li><b>Making models available to others.</b>  Installing useful
models in a systemwide directory can make it much more convenient for
other researchers to search those models using
<tt>associate</tt>.</li>
<li><b>Keeping experimental models and known useful models
separate.</b>  If you create all models initially under one directory,
then copy those that prove useful to another directory, you can reduce
the risk of accidentally overwriting a model you want to keep around.
This will allow you to experiment with model creation with less fear
of messing something up.</li>
<li><b>Conserving disk space.</b>  Some intermediate model files that are not
needed for search are kept around by <tt>infomap-build</tt> because
they might be useful for other forms of experimentation.  By
installing only those files needed for search and deleting the working copy
of a model, disk space is saved.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>A default systemwide model directory is determined when the Infomap
NLP software is <a href="#building_s">installed</a>.  Typically this
directory will be <tt>/usr/local/share/infomap-nlp/models</tt>.  The
default behavior of <tt>infomap-install</tt> is to install models as
subdirectories of this directory.  Note that special permissions (such
as root access) will typically be required to install models to this
directory.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the installation directory can be specified using
either the <tt>INFOMAP_MODEL_DIR</tt> environment variable (which
overrides the systemwide default) or the <tt>-i</tt> command-line
option to <tt>infomap-install</tt> (which overrides both
<tt>INFOMAP_MODEL_DIR</tt> and the systemwide default).  See the
<tt>infomap-install(1)</tt> manual page for details.</p>

<p>For instance, imagine that we have built the <tt>sf</tt> model from
the <tt>sf</tt> example corpus as described above, and that the
<tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt> environment variable is not set.  Then the
commands<pre>
  $ su
  Password: (enter root password)
  # infomap-install sf
  # exit
  $
</pre>
will copy the <tt>sf</tt> model data directory and some of its
contents from <tt>/home/jrandom/infomap_models</tt> to the systemwide
model directory.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <pre>
  $ export INFOMAP_MODEL_DIR=/home/jrandom/installed-models
  $ infomap-install sf
</pre>
will copy the <tt>sf</tt> model data directory and some of its
contents into the directory <tt>/home/jrandom/installed-models</tt>.
So will <pre>
  $ infomap-install -i /home/jrandom/installed-models sf
</pre>
</p>

<p>See the <tt>infomap-install(1)</tt> manual page for more options.</p>

command</a></li>

command</a></li>

</ul>    

<h3><a name="assoc_cmd"/>The <tt>associate</tt> command</h3>
<p>Searching is done using the <tt>associate</tt> command.  Details
about the operation of this command can be found in the
<tt>associate(1)</tt> man page.  We describe common ways of using this
command below.</p>

<p>Suppose that we want to search the <tt>sf</tt> model that we built
in the example above, and that we have not yet installed this model
using <tt>infomap-install</tt>.  Imagine that we want to find
words related to suits (the article of clothing, not lawsuits).  Then
we run the command<pre>
  $ associate -t -c sf suit NOT lawsuit
</pre>
The <tt>suit NOT lawsuit</tt> part of this command is the
<i>query</i>; it describes what we are looking for.  The 
<tt>-c</tt> option tells which model to search (think
&quot;corpus&quot; to remember this option).  The argument to the
<tt>-c</tt> option is the <i>model tag</i>, or name, of the model to
be searched.  The <tt>-t</tt> option tells <tt>associate</tt> to use a
temporary working model, rather than an installed model; this means
that <tt>associate</tt> looks for the model data directory in
<tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt>.</p>

<p>How does associate find models that <i>have</i> been installed
using <tt>infomap-install</tt>?  It uses the
<tt>INFOMAP_MODEL_PATH</tt>.  This environment variable, similar in
nature to the <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>MANPATH</tt> variables, contains a
list of directories, separated by colons, in which Infomap model data
directories might be found.  For instance, to look for Infomap models
only in the systemwide data directory, you could issue the
command<pre>
  $ INFOMAP_MODEL_PATH=/usr/local/share/infomap-nlp/models
  $ export INFOMAP_MODEL_PATH
</pre>
or, under <tt>csh</tt><pre>
  % setenv INFOMAP_MODEL_PATH /usr/local/share/infomap-nlp/models
</pre>With this path, the command<pre>
  $ associate -c sf suit NOT lawsuit
</pre>
would perform the same search as above, but would expect to find the
<tt>sf</tt> model in <tt>/usr/local/share/infomap-nlp/models</tt>
(where it would be copied by <tt>infomap-install</tt>) rather than in <tt>/home/jrandom/infomap-models</tt>.</p>

<p>By default, <tt>associate</tt> retrieves words matching the query;
using the <tt>-d</tt> option tells it to retrieve documents instead.</p>



<h3><a name="assoc_outpt"/>Output of the <tt>associate</tt>
command</h3>
<p>The <tt>associate</tt> command returns as its output a list of the
words or documents best matching the query, in descending order of
relevance.  Each line of output consists of either a word or a
document ID, followed by a colon, followed by a similarity score
indicating how good a match for the query that word or document is
judged to be.  In the case of document retrieval, the document ID can
then be used to obtain the document itself.</p>

<p>By default, associate will return the 20 words or documents that
best match the query.  The <tt>-n</tt> command-line option can be used
to override this default and specify how many words or documents to
return.</p>

<p>The <tt>-f</tt> command-line option will cause the matching words
and documents, and the <a href="algorithm.html">WordSpace vector</a>
for each, to be written to the specified file.  This can be useful for
further processing.  (For instance, the Infomap Word Spectrum Plotter
can use these files as a source of items and coordinates to plot.)</p>

<h3><a name="doc_retrieval"/>Retrieving documents with document
ID's</h3>
<p>Once we have run an <tt>associate</tt> command with the
<tt>-d</tt> option to retrieve documents, then what?  
We have a list of &quot;document
ID's&quot;, but what do they mean, and how do we use them to get the
documents themselves?</p>

<p>First of all, we should point out that document retrieval fetches
documents from the original corpus, so the corpus must be in the same
location and have exactly the same format as it did when we built the
model in order for document retrieval to function reliably.  If this
is the case, we can use the <tt>print_doc</tt> command to look up
documents from the document ID's and print them out.</p>

<p>The <tt>print_doc</tt> command is extremely simple.  It accepts one
or more document ID's on the command line, and it prints the document
corresponding to each ID to standard out.  If more than one document
is printed, the documents are separated by a blank line, a line
containing &quot;<tt>===</tt>&quot;, and another blank line.</p>

<p>The <tt>print_doc</tt> program determines which model to use 
in the same way that <tt>associate</tt>
does.  That is, it takes a <tt>-c</tt> option whose argument is the
model tag, and searches for a directory of that name in the
<tt>INFOMAP_MODEL_PATH</tt> or, if the <tt>-t</tt> option has been
given, in the <tt>INFOMAP_WORKING_DIR</tt>.  If <tt>print_doc</tt>
finds a model different from the one <tt>associate</tt> used to
retrieve the results, then its results will be meaningless, so be careful.

<p>It is much easier to perform document retrieval with the Infomap
web interface, which is planned for future release.</p>
