Infomap NLP Software
--------------------

Please see the file "INSTALL" for installation instructions; this
package uses GNU Autoconf and Automake, so the general idea is
"./configure; make; make install".

To get started, it is recommended that you read either the Infomap
User's Manual or the Infomap Tutorial; both are provided in HTML
format.  Both are distributed in the doc/html/ subdirectory of this
directory; they will be installed to $prefix/share/doc/infomap-nlp/
(by default, /usr/local/share/doc/infomap-nlp/).  Please begin with
the index.html file.

This distribution comes with an extensive set of man pages; these are
intended to be as complete and detailed as possible and will probably
serve much better as references than as a tutorial.

The software in this package is Copyright (c) Stanford University,
except for the SVDPACKC linear algebra library, which is Copyright (c)
University of Tennessee.  Please see the file COPYING in this
directory for the terms under which you may use the software.

This software was created by the Infomap Project in the Computational
Semantics Lab at the Center for the Study of Language and Information
(CSLI) at Stanford University.  The SVDPACKC linear algebra library
was created by the University of Tennessee and is available from netlib.org.

Please direct questions and comments regarding the software to
infomap-nlp-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

Thank you; we hope you will find the software useful.
